They count asTier II (supplementary) capitalunderBasel-IIIand help improve theCAR.CARindicates a bank’sfinancial strength, with a higher ratio providing a strongerbuffer against distress.CAR= (Eligible Capital ÷ Risk-Weighted Assets) × 100%.Tier II Bonds are different fromTier I Bondsas they strengthen a bank’ssupplementary capital, whereasTier I (AT1) Bondsstrengthen itscore capital (equity and retained earnings).
• Key Features of Tier II Bonds:Maturity:They are typicallylong-term instrumentswith original maturities of at least5 years.Subordination:Tier II bondholdersare paid after alldepositors,senior debt holders, andgeneral creditorsin the event of aliquidation. However, they rank aboveequity holders.Coupon Payments:They pay regularinterest (coupons)and generally offerhigher coupon ratesthan senior bonds due tohigher risk.Call Options:MostTier II bondsinclude acall option, allowing the bank toredeem the bondsafter a specified period (e.g.,5 or 10 years).Loss Absorbency (Gone-Concern Capital):Tier I capital is considered"gone-concern" capital, meaning it is intended toabsorb lossesif a bank fails and is in the process of beingwound up.This is in contrast toTier I capital, which absorbs losses on a"going-concern"basis while the bank is stilloperational.
• Issued By:Both public and private banks issueTier II bondsto meetregulatory capital requirements, supportbusiness expansion, and comply withCAR normswithout issuing new equity and diluting shareholders.
• Investors in Tier II Bonds:Institutional investorssuch as insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds, as well asretail investorsthrough platforms or public issues, invest in Tier II bonds.

• This is in contrast toTier I capital, which absorbs losses on a"going-concern"basis while the bank is stilloperational.


What is the Difference Between Tier I and Tier II Bonds?


Tier I Bonds (Commonly called Additional Tier 1 or AT1)

Tier II Bonds (Subordinated Debt)

To act as shock absorbers duringongoing stress. They are thefirst line of defenseafter equity.

To act as a loss-absorbing buffer duringliquidation or winding up.

Perpetual; they haveno maturity date. They are the most junior form of debt, just above equity.

Have afixed maturity. They are senior to Tier I but junior to regular debt.

Can be written down to zero or converted to equity if the bank'sCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratiofalls below a pre-specified level.

Loss absorption typicallyonly happensduring the point ofnon-viability or liquidation, after Tier I is used.


What are Basel Norms?


• About:Basel Norms are a set of internationalbanking regulationsdeveloped by theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)to strengthen theglobal financial systemby ensuring that banks hold enoughcapitalto absorbunexpected losses.
• Pillars of Basel Norms:The Basel framework rests onthree pillars:Pillar 1 – Minimum Capital Requirements:Banks must hold capital proportional to theirrisk-weighted assets (RWA), with riskier assets requiring more capital.Pillar 2 – Supervisory Review:Regulators assess each bank’sinternal risk processesand ensure capital staysabove minimum requirements.Pillar 3 – Market Discipline:Banks mustdisclosetheir risk profiles and capital levels to promotetransparencyand encourage prudent behavior through market scrutiny.
• Evolution:Basel has evolved fromBasel I, II, III, and now IVto strengthen the banking system and respond to financial crises.Basel I (1988)introduced a capital measurement system focused oncredit riskandrisk-weighted assets, setting minimum capital requirements for banks.Basel II (2004)refined this by adding the three-pillar framework ofminimum capital,supervisory review, andmarket discipline.Basel III (2010), developed after the 2007–08 crisis, strengthened banks’capital base,liquidity, andleverage standards.Basel IV (2017)aims to tighten remaining gaps by makingRWA calculationsmore consistent across banks and limiting the misuse of internal models to reduce capital requirements.
