Climate changeis increasing severefloods,making resilience vital. Global best practices such asTanzania's Msimbazi Basin Projectshows how nature-based solutions and modern infrastructure can reduce risks and strengthen climate resilience,offering lessons for India’s flood management strategies.


What are the Leading Global Best Practices in Flood Risk Management?


• Tanzania’s Msimbazi Basin Development Project:A World Bank-funded project inDar es Salaamaims to reduce flooding by dredging the river, improving drainage, and upgrading infrastructure.It also relocates vulnerable residents and converts floodplains into green, climate-resilient areas.
• Netherlands’s Floating Homes:Built withconcrete and glass, these flood-resistant homes float during floods, preventing water intrusion. Solar panels and heat exchangers provide continuous power.
• Vienna’s Flood Protection System:In 1969,Vienna built a 21-km flood relief channel parallel to the Danube River.This channel absorbs excess floodwater, relieving pressure on the main river, and activates only when needed to protect the city.
• China’s Sponge Cities:The"Sponge Cities"utilize nature-based solutions likepermeable surfaces and wetlands to absorband store rainwater, mimicking Earth's natural water absorption, unlike traditional cities that rapidly drain water via hard surfaces.
• Denmark’s Green Climate Screen:A rainwater system channels water from gutters to mineral wool behind willow panels, absorbing moisture naturally.Excess water flows to planters or green spaces, reducing flood risks without costly infrastructure or energy use.
• Texas-Harnessing AI and Satellite Imagery:TheUniversity of Arizona and Google's Flood Hub use AI and satellite data to create detailed flood mapsand provide 7-day forecasts, improving flood justice and global preparedness.

• It also relocates vulnerable residents and converts floodplains into green, climate-resilient areas.

• This channel absorbs excess floodwater, relieving pressure on the main river, and activates only when needed to protect the city.

• Excess water flows to planters or green spaces, reducing flood risks without costly infrastructure or energy use.


How Vulnerable is India to Flood Risks?


• Extent of Flood-Prone Area:Out of India’s total 329 million hectares, over40 million hectares are vulnerable to floods.India leads globally with over 158 million slum dwellers in flood-prone areas.Also, India experienced5.4 million internal displacements in 2024 due to floods, storms,and other disasters- the highest number in 12 years.
• Economic Impact:Analysis of the past two decades showsfloods cause around 63% of India’s annual economic losses.Monsoon patterns have become highly unpredictable, with sudden heavy rainfall causing floods and prolonged dry spells leading to drought.

• Also, India experienced5.4 million internal displacements in 2024 due to floods, storms,and other disasters- the highest number in 12 years.

• Monsoon patterns have become highly unpredictable, with sudden heavy rainfall causing floods and prolonged dry spells leading to drought.


What are the Key Strategies Adopted for Flood Risk Management in India?


• In India,flood controlis primarily aState subject, thus, the responsibility for flood control lies largely with theState Governments, while theCentral Government's roleis moretechnical,advisory, andsupportive.
• Engineering/Structural Measures:Interlinking of Rivers:Under theNational Perspective Plan (NPP),interlinking of rivers can help prevent floods by diverting excess water from flood-prone basins, such as theGanga–Brahmaputra–Meghna,to water-scarce regions.Thisredistributes water flow, reduces peak discharge in rivers during heavy rains,and minimizes the risk of overflowing banks and inundation in vulnerable areas.Reservoirs: Helpmoderate flood intensity by storing water during high discharge periods and releasing it after the peak flow.Their effectiveness depends on capacity and proximity to flood-prone areas.Detention Basins: These are natural depressions improved by constructing embankments and regulating water release. Examples include basins inRajasthanandBihar.Embankments: Prevent floodwaters from spilling over. These are widely used but may have long-term issues like riverbed elevation and erosion. Maintenance is crucial, especially in places likeAssamandBihar.Channelization: It involves controlling river courses and improving hydraulic conditions to prevent flooding.Dredginganddesiltinghelp rivers carry floodwaters efficiently.Diversion of Flood Waters:Diversion channelsand spillways help direct floodwaters away from vulnerable areas.Examples include theKrishna-Godavari Drainage SchemeandThottapally SpillwayinKerala.
• Administrative/Non-Structural Measures:Flood Forecasting and Warning: TheCentral Water Commissionprovides real-time flood forecasts, which help authorities evacuate people and property to safer areas.Flood Plain Zoning: Involves designating areas prone to flooding and regulating development in these regions to minimize flood damage.Flood Proofing: This involves raising settlements above the flood levels, particularly in areas likeUttar Pradesh,West Bengal, andAssam.

What is Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCOs)?


• About:TheOCOsare a series ofNASA’s Earth observation satellites designed toprovide crucial data fortracking CO2sources and sinks,and their impact onglobalclimate systems.Thefirst mission, OCO (2009), failed due to a launch vehicle fairing issue.However,the subsequent mission,OCO-2 (2014),was successfully launched, measuring atmosphericCO2, identifying its sources and sinks, and tracking crop health through the 'glow' ofplant photosynthesis.It operates in asun-synchronous polar orbitto observe any location at thesame time of day.OCO-3 (2019), installed in theISS,orbits Earth every 90 minutes, allowingobservations of the same location at multiple timesof day and providing complementary data to OCO-2.
• Significance:OCO satellites provideglobal, high-resolution CO2data, trackingseasonal and regional variations.For decades,tropical rainforestswere considered theplanet's lungs, clearing vast amounts ofCO2. However, OCO-2 data revealed thatboreal forests (taiga),the coniferous forests in higher latitudes, play a significant role inCO2absorption.Additionally, OCO data showed that naturalcarbon sinkscan transform into carbon sources during events like droughts ordeforestation.By detecting light fromphotosynthesis, OCOsmap global plant growth,aidingclimate mitigationandpolicy formulation for emission reduction.
