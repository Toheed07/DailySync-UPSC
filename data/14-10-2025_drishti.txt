Why in News?


Himachal Pradesh is witnessing a major shift as thousands of farmersmove away from chemical-based agriculture towardnatural farming.This transition reflects India’s wider push forsustainable and eco-friendly agriculture.


What is Natural Farming?


• Definition:As per NITI Aayog, Natural Farming is“a chemical-free traditional farming method”rooted in agroecological principlesintegrating crops, trees, livestock, and functional biodiversity.It follows the philosophy ofworking with nature, emphasizingminimal human intervention(often referred to as“do-nothing farming”) and thecomplete avoidance of synthetic chemicals.
• Key Features and Principles:No External Chemical Inputs: Completely avoids chemical fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and growth regulators.On-farm Input Generation: It relies on agricultural inputs such asNeemastra, Agniastra, Jeevamrit,andBeejamrit,which arelocally prepared on farmsusing materials likecow dung, cow urine, jaggery, gram flour,andsoil.Livestock Integration: Native cow breeds are central forsourcing inputsand maintaining the nutrient cycle.Diversified Cropping System: Encouragesintercropping, mixed cropping, agroforestry,and crop rotation.Soil Health and Biodiversity: Emphasizesmulching, cover cropping, and maintaining microbial activity for fertile and living soil.Water efficiency: Uses minimal irrigation and improves soil moisture retention naturally.
• Scientific and Environmental Benefits:Enhancessoil organic carbonandsoil fertility, reducing the need for synthetic inputs.Promotesbiodiversity, including beneficial insects, pollinators, and soil organisms.Reducesgreenhouse gas emissionsby avoiding urea and other nitrogenous fertilizers.Improvesclimate resilienceof farms, especially under drought and erratic rainfall conditions.

How is Natural Farming Benefiting Farmers and Rural Livelihoods in India?


• Reduced Cost of Cultivation:Natural farming is not just an ecological alternative but also offerstangible socio-economic benefitsto Indian farmers. TheZero budget natural farming (ZBNF)is the most popular model in India.The cost of inputs under natural farming is50–60% lower than conventional chemical farming.Farmerssignificantly save on input costssince bio-inputs are prepared on-farm using locally available resources.
• Improved Farmer Incomes:Though initial yields may be stable or slightly reduced,long-term productivity is sustained or increaseddue to improved soil health.Income stability is achieved throughintercropping, value-added products, and reduced crop failure risk.
• Employment Generation:Encourageslocal entrepreneurshipin bio-input production, seed banks, composting, and local market chains. Promotesrural youth participationby making agriculture more knowledge-based and sustainable.
• Health and Food Security:Natural produce is free from harmful pesticide residues, ensuring better nutrition and food safety.Enhancesnutritional densityof food, addressing concerns of hidden hunger and health disorders due to chemicals.
• Women Empowerment:Involves women in preparation of bio-inputs, composting, kitchen gardening, and farmer producer groups.

• The cost of inputs under natural farming is50–60% lower than conventional chemical farming.

• Enhancesnutritional densityof food, addressing concerns of hidden hunger and health disorders due to chemicals.


What are India’s Initiatives for Natural Farming?


• National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF):A centrally sponsored scheme by theMinistry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, promotingchemical-free, ecosystem-based natural farming rooted in traditional knowledge.TheNMNFtargets7.5 lakh hectaresacross15,000 clustersand aims to facilitate1 crore farmers.An incentive of Rs 4,000 per acre per year for two years is being provided to encourage adoption of natural farming practices.NMNF builds on the earlierBhartiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati (BPKP)under theParamparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY).

• TheNMNFtargets7.5 lakh hectaresacross15,000 clustersand aims to facilitate1 crore farmers.
• An incentive of Rs 4,000 per acre per year for two years is being provided to encourage adoption of natural farming practices.
• NMNF builds on the earlierBhartiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati (BPKP)under theParamparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY).

• Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati (BPKP):As of March 2025 it supports28 lakh farmerspracticing natural farming on9.4 lakh hectares.
• State-Level Initiatives:


What are the Key Challenges in Mainstreaming Natural Farming Across India?


• Knowledge and Skill Gaps:Natural farming is knowledge-intensive and site-specific, requiring farmers to understand ecological interactions and adopt new practices.Many farmers, especially in remote areas,lack practical understandingand require continuous handholding by Krishi Sakhis.
• Behavioural Resistance:Farmers accustomed tohigh-input, chemical-intensive practicesoften hesitate to shift tolow-input, labour-intensive natural farming.
• State-Level Variability:Successful models exist inHimachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, etc., butsoil, climate, and social conditions vary, makinguniform replication challenging.
• Policy Convergence Complexity:Coordinating NMNF withother central/state schemes (livestock, rural development,AYUSH, food processing)and local institutions isadministratively challenging.
• Market Linkages and Premium Pricing:Establishingreliable markets for chemical-free produceremains a challenge.Farmers may hesitate to switch ifpremium pricing and assured minimum support price (MSP)are not consistently available.
• Input Availability and Infrastructure:Ensuringtimely availability of bio-inputsacross all regions, especially remote areas, requires robustBio-input Resource Centres (BRCs)and supply chains.

• Many farmers, especially in remote areas,lack practical understandingand require continuous handholding by Krishi Sakhis.

• Farmers may hesitate to switch ifpremium pricing and assured minimum support price (MSP)are not consistently available.


What Measures can be Adopted to Scale Natural Farming in India?


• Decentralized Farmer Clusters:Formcontiguous natural farming clustersto enable peer learning, reduce input costs, and facilitate community-level extension support.
• Strengthen Knowledge Networks:DeployKrishi Sakhis, Community Resource Persons, and KVKsto provide hands-on training in NF techniques, bio-input preparation, pest management, and multi-cropping.
• Bio-input Accessibility:Establishlocal Bio-input Resource Centres (BRCs)and promote on-farm production of organic inputs to reduce dependency on external chemical inputs.
• Market Integration and Certification:DevelopPGS/organic certification, promote anational brand for NF produce, and strengthen linkages withAgricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs), Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), and local marketsto ensure fair pricing.
• Agro-ecology Based Research:Tailorregion-specific NF cropping systemsand soil-moisture management practices to enhance resilience in varied agro-climatic zones.
• Digital Monitoring and Knowledge Sharing:Usegeo-tagged tracking, online portals, and mobile advisory servicesto monitor adoption, yields, and ecological outcomes while providing timely guidance.


Conclusion


Natural farming promotesnutrient-rich, chemical-free foodwhilereducing input costsfor farmers. It aligns with India’s broader sustainability goals, supportingSDG 2 (Zero Hunger)by improving food security, andSDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production)by encouraging eco-friendly agricultural practices.
