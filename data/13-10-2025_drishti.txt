For Mains: Labour Rights and Industrial Safety in India, Challenges in Enforcement of Labour Laws, Informal Sector and Social Security Measures


Why in News?


TheSigachi Industries reactor blast in Telangana, along with a spate of industrial accidents in 2025, hasreignited concerns over industrial safety standardsand theweakening of labour protections,reviving debates on the erosion of workers’ rights in India.


What are the Reasons for Rising Industrial Accidents in India?


• Negligence and Cost-Cutting:Employers oftenignore maintenance,use outdated machinery, and skip safety checks leading to frequent industrial accidents.TheInternational Labour Organization (ILO)states that industrial accidents are rarely random and they usually result from employers cutting corners, underinvesting in safety, or forcing workers into long hours and high pressure due to low wages.
• Lack of Training and Safety Systems:Workers arepoorly trained,and many siteslack alarms, safety gear, or emergency facilitiesleading to mishandling of equipment and delayed response during crises.AtSigachi Industries, the reactor reportedly ran attwice the permissible temperaturewithout anyalarm or intervention, underscoring serious safety lapses.
• Overwork and Fatigue:Long hours andhigh work pressureincrease mistakes in hazardous environments.
• Weak Law Enforcement:Irregular inspections and poor enforcement allow unsafe practices to continue.
• Unregistered Workers:Informal workers lack records, legal protection, and access to compensation, increasing vulnerability.
• Deliberate Actions to Claim Insurance:Some accidents are manipulated or exaggerated to secure insurance payouts, contributing to underreporting of actual workplace safety practices.

• AtSigachi Industries, the reactor reportedly ran attwice the permissible temperaturewithout anyalarm or intervention, underscoring serious safety lapses.


What are the Key Labour Laws Governing Workers' Rights in India?


• Factories Act, 1948:Governs working conditions, machinery maintenance, safety standards, working hours, rest breaks, canteens, and crèches.Includes provisions for inspections and enforcement to ensure compliance.It was amended in 1976 and 1987, the latter after theBhopal Gas Tragedy,to strengthen safety norms.
• Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923:Provides compensation to workers injured or killed on the job.
• Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Act, 1948:Offers health insurance, medical care, and cash benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity, or employment-related injury.
• Payment of Wages Act, 1936andMinimum Wages Act, 1948: Ensure timely and fair payment.
• Industrial Disputes Act, 1947: Protects workers’ rights regarding termination, layoffs, and dispute resolution.
• Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2020:Consolidates 13 previous labour laws into a single framework.OSHWC Codeseeks to regulate safety, health, and working conditions across sectors, though full implementation is pending.

• Includes provisions for inspections and enforcement to ensure compliance.
• It was amended in 1976 and 1987, the latter after theBhopal Gas Tragedy,to strengthen safety norms.


What are the Challenges in Protecting Workers’ Rights in India?


• Systemic Erosion of Legal Safeguards:Labour protections have been diluted under the guise of flexibility andease of doing business,weakening enforcement mechanisms.For example,Maharashtra’s 2015 self-certification ruleallowed factories to bypass independent inspections, undermining statutory safety provisions.
• Normalization of Informality and Vulnerability:Policy shiftsfavoring employer discretion to hire, fire, and extract workwithout oversight have entrenched informal employment, leaving workers unregistered and without legal or social protection.Most contract workers inSivakasi fireworks factoriesoperate without formal records, making accident compensation irregular and delayed.
• Gendered Exclusion from Economic Gains:Weak enforcement of workplace rights disproportionatelyaffects women,constraining participation andperpetuating gender exclusion
• Corporate Accountability Deficit:Reduced inspections and self-certification limit avenues tohold employers criminally or financially responsible for negligence.For instance, industrial disasters like the Ennore coal-handling collapse saw minimal legal consequences for structural failures despite evident lapses.
• Long-Term Economic and Productivity Impact:Unsafe and exploitative work conditions lower productivity, with informal trade workers earningUSD 5/hour, nearly half the national average ofUSD 11/hour, undermining India’s Viksit Bharat 2047 goals.

• Most contract workers inSivakasi fireworks factoriesoperate without formal records, making accident compensation irregular and delayed.

• For instance, industrial disasters like the Ennore coal-handling collapse saw minimal legal consequences for structural failures despite evident lapses.


How can India Strengthen Worker Rights and Improve Safety?


• Reinforce Legal Safeguards:Fully implement the OSHWC Code, 2020, and align labour policies withILO conventionson workplace safety, decent work, and social protection.
• Formalisation and Social Security:Digitally register informal workers through theShram Suvidha Portaland integrate them intouniversal social security coverage, including pensions, health insurance, and paid leave.Expand thePradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM)pension scheme to cover all informal trade workers.
• Skill Development and Safety Training:Implement sector-specific safety and skilling programs viaNational Skill Development Corporation (NSDC)andSkill India Mission.Accelerate the implementation ofMission Digital ShramSetuas proposed by NITI Aayog.LeverageAI-enabled monitoring and predictive toolsunder#AIforAllto track compliance and hazards in high-risk industries.
• Gender-Inclusive MeasuresPromote female workforce participation throughworkplace childcare facilities, maternity benefits under theMaternity Benefit Act, 1961, and vocational training programs targeted at women in informal sectors.
• Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Compliance:Encourage adherence toEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)criteria among businesses.Integrateworker welfare considerationsinto corporate CSR strategies.
• Promote Collective Action and Safety Culture:Encouragecollective bargaining, worker representation, andwhistleblower protection.Foster a“safety-first” industrial culture, treating worker protection as an investment rather than a cost.
• Data-Driven Monitoring:Establishnational dashboardsto track compliance, accident rates, and social protection coverage, enabling targeted policy interventions and preventing negligence.

For Mains: Efficacy and risks of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) as a climate mitigation strategy, its associated challenges, India's position and initiatives in CCUS.


Why in News?


AClimate Analytics reportwarns that Asia’s vastCarbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS)plans could result in nearly25 billion tonnes of extragreenhouse gasemissions by 2050.

• This is because most CCS projects acrossChina, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesiaaredesigned less to cut emissions and more to extend the life of coal, oil, and gas.


What is Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage?


• About:CCUS is a suite of technologies thatcapture CO₂ emissionsfrom major sources likepower plants, refineries, and industries, orremove CO₂ from the atmosphere.
• Working of CCUS:CCUSinvolves three main stages —capture, transport, and storage (or use)ofCO₂.Capture methods include:Post-combustion: SeparatesCO₂ from flue gasusing solvents after fuel combustion.Pre-combustion: Converts fuel into a hydrogen–CO₂ mix before burning, then separates CO₂.Oxy-fuel combustion: Burns fuel in pure oxygen, producing CO₂ and steam for easy capture.Captured CO₂ iscompressed and transportedviapipeline, ship, rail, or roadandinjected into deep geological formationslikedepleted oil and gas fields or saline aquifersforlong-term storage. Alternatively, it may beused in commercial applications.
• Role in Tackling Climate Change:CCUSplays a key role inglobal decarbonisationby:Reducing emissionsinhard-to-abate sectorslike steel,cement (7% of global emissions), and chemicals.Producing low-carbon electricity and hydrogento replace fossil fuels across industries and transport.Removing existing CO₂from the atmosphere throughBioenergywith CCS (BECCS)andDirect Air Capture(DACCS).It can be installed oncoal, gas, or biomass plants, enhancingenergy securityby diversifying low-carbon energy sources.

• Capture methods include:Post-combustion: SeparatesCO₂ from flue gasusing solvents after fuel combustion.Pre-combustion: Converts fuel into a hydrogen–CO₂ mix before burning, then separates CO₂.Oxy-fuel combustion: Burns fuel in pure oxygen, producing CO₂ and steam for easy capture.

• Removing existing CO₂from the atmosphere throughBioenergywith CCS (BECCS)andDirect Air Capture(DACCS).
• It can be installed oncoal, gas, or biomass plants, enhancingenergy securityby diversifying low-carbon energy sources.


Why Does Asia’s Increasing Dependence on CCUS Raise Climate Concerns?


• Massive Excess Emissions:Depending on theCCUS scenario,Asiacould emit an additional24.9 gigatonnes of CO₂-equivalent by 2050—more than the combinedfossil fuel emissionsofSouth KoreaandAustralia.Thisovershootisn't minor; it's a potentialdisasterthat would single-handedly jeopardizeglobal climate targets.
• Economic Lock-In:Ahigh-CCS pathwayriskslocking countries into expensive, outdated fossil fuel infrastructure, creatingstranded assetsanddiverting investment from cleaner alternatives.
• Exacerbate Regional Vulnerabilities:Ahigh-CCS pathwayfuels theclimate threatsthat most endangerAsia—sea-level rise,monsoonal instability, andheatwaves—while perpetuatingdeadly air pollutionfromuncaptured NOx and SOx.
• Growing Energy Demand:Governmentsare usingCCUSas anenergy security strategyto exploitdomestic fossil fuelslikecoalandgas, paying lip service toclimate goalswhile avoiding a fullrenewable transition.

• Thisovershootisn't minor; it's a potentialdisasterthat would single-handedly jeopardizeglobal climate targets.


What is India’s Current Status in the CCUS?


• Limited Deployment:India currently hasminimal CCS infrastructurewithno major operational projects or storage facilities, leaving itlargely disconnected from regional CCS networks.
• CCU Testbeds for Cement Sector:India has launched itsfirst cluster of five CCU testbedsfor thecement sector, under aPublic-Private Partnership (PPP)model, focusing on:Oxygen-enhanced Calcination:ConvertingCO₂ into concrete blocks and olefins(e.g., ethylene, propylene).Carbon-negative Mineralisation:Permanently locking CO₂into rock formations.Vacuum Swing Adsorption:Separating CO₂from cement kiln gases andintegrating it back into construction materials.
• National Centres in Carbon Capture:Supported by theDepartment of Science & Technology,India is establishingtwo National Centres of Excellence (CoE) in Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) at:NCoE-CCU at IIT Bombay, Mumbai,andNCCCU at JNCASR, Bengaluru.
• Renewable Advantage:India’s progress insolar, wind, electric mobility,andgreen hydrogenoffers a decarbonisation pathway without heavyCCUS.USD 4.3 billionin government support forCCSraises debate on directing funds towardrenewablesandgreen innovation.

• Oxygen-enhanced Calcination:ConvertingCO₂ into concrete blocks and olefins(e.g., ethylene, propylene).
• Carbon-negative Mineralisation:Permanently locking CO₂into rock formations.

• NCoE-CCU at IIT Bombay, Mumbai,and
• NCCCU at JNCASR, Bengaluru.

• USD 4.3 billionin government support forCCSraises debate on directing funds towardrenewablesandgreen innovation.


What are the Key Concerns Associated with CCUS?


• Low Capture Efficiency:MostCCS projects capture only around 50% of CO₂, far below the95%required for meaningfulemission abatement, making them less effective as a climate solution.
• Fossil Fuel Dependence:About80% of existing CCS projectsuse captured CO₂ forEnhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), whichextends fossil fuel extractionrather than reducing it.
• High Economic Costs:CCS-based power generationcan makeelectricity up to twice as expensiveas renewables with storage.CCUS facilitiesare bothcapital- and energy-intensive, raising concerns abouteconomic viability, especially in Asia.
• Sectoral Misalignment:MostCCS projects target fossil fuel sectorslike gas,LNG, and hydrogen production — areas that already havezero-emission alternatives— whilehard-to-abate sectorssuch assteel and cementreceive minimal investment.
• Emergence of Cheaper Alternatives:Renewables, electrification, and energy efficiencyare alreadymore cost-effectivethan fossil fuels with CCS. Ahigh-CCS pathwaycould cost up toUSD 30 trillion more globallyby 2050 compared to a low-CCS route.
• Environmental Risks:Potential CO₂ leakagefrom underground storage couldreverse emission reductionsanddamage ecosystems.


What Strategy Should India Adopt for CCUS in its Green Transition Pathway?


• Prioritize Renewables:Focus onsolar, wind, green hydrogen, and electric mobilityas primary decarbonization pathways. Use CCUSonly where emissions are hard to abate, such as steel, cement, and chemical industries.
• Pilot and Scale Selectively:Implementsmall-scale, high-efficiency CCUS projectsto evaluate cost-effectiveness and environmental safety. Avoid blanket deployment that encouragescontinued fossil fuel reliance.
• Develop Storage Atlas:Storage is as crucial as the Capture; without safe, accessible storage,CCUSis ineffective.Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)and theGeological Survey of India (GSI)should mapdepleted oil and gas fields(e.g.,Bombay High) anddeep saline aquifersto reduceinvestment risks.
• Technology Transfer & Finance: Negotiatewith developed countries forCCUS technology and finance, positioning it as key forGlobal South industrialization.Invest in R&DforDirect Air Capture (DAC)andBECCSto lead inclimate restoration technologies.

• Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)and theGeological Survey of India (GSI)should mapdepleted oil and gas fields(e.g.,Bombay High) anddeep saline aquifersto reduceinvestment risks.


Conclusion


Asia's over-reliance on CCUSas aprimary climate strategyrisksmassive emissions, economic lock-in, andderailing the 1.5°C goal. ForIndiaand others, prioritizingproven, cheaper alternativeslikerenewablesandgreen hydrogenovercostly, inefficient CCUSis the more viable path todecarbonization.
