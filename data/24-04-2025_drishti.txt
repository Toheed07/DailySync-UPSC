Why in News?


TheCabinet Committee on Security,chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has approved a5-point action planagainst Pakistan following the deadly terrorist attack inBaisaran valley (Pahalgam), Jammu and Kashmir,which claimed the lives of 26 civilians.

• The Resistance Front (TRF),a proxy of banned Pakistan-basedLashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack.

Note:The TRF surfaced in 2020. It was declared a terrorist organisation by theMinistry of Home Affairsin 2023 under theUnlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967for its involvement in terror recruitment, infiltration, and smuggling from Pakistan into J&K.

• TRF's rise followed two key developments: thedecapitation of LeT's top leadershipin 2018 and the revocation of J&K’s special status in 2019.


What is the 5-Point Action Plan Announced by India After the Pahalgam Terror Attack?


• Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty:India hassuspended the1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)until Pakistan ceases its support forcross-border terrorism.It reflects a shift in India’s strategic calculus, usinghydrological leverageas a pressure tool.
• Closure of the Attari-Wagah Border Check Post:India hasshut down theIntegrated Check Post (ICP)at Attari, Punjabsuspending all movement of people and goods.Only individuals who have crossed over with valid documents will be permitted to return by1stMay 2025.
• Cancellation of SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistan:India hasrevoked theSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES)for Pakistani nationals.All SVES visas already issued are consideredvoid.
• Expulsion of Pakistani Military Advisors:Pakistan’s Defence, Naval, and Air advisors in New Delhi have been declaredpersona non grataand must exit India. India will also withdraw its own advisors from Islamabad.
• Reduction of Diplomatic Personnel:India will reduce the staff strength at its High Commission in Islamabad to 30, down from 55, by1stMay 2025.This marks a cleardowngrade in diplomatic engagement, intended to freeze bilateral dialogue at the official level.

• It reflects a shift in India’s strategic calculus, usinghydrological leverageas a pressure tool.

• Only individuals who have crossed over with valid documents will be permitted to return by1stMay 2025.

• All SVES visas already issued are consideredvoid.

• This marks a cleardowngrade in diplomatic engagement, intended to freeze bilateral dialogue at the official level.


How has Pakistan Responded to India’s Five-Point Action Plan?


• Suspension of Bilateral Agreements:Pakistan declared it would consider placing “all bilateral agreements” with India, including the1972 Simla Agreement, in abeyance.
• Trade suspension:All forms of trade with India, including transit trade via third countries, have been suspended.India-Pakistan trade had shown signs of recovery, reaching USD 1.2 billion in 2024, a 127% increase from 2023. Suspension reverses these gains.
• Strong rejection of IWT Suspension:Pakistan condemned India's suspension of the IWT, calling it unacceptable and warned that any diversion of river waters under the treaty would be considered an"act of war."
• Airspace Closure:In a move similar to the2019 post-Pulwama airspace closure,Pakistan has once again shut its skies to all Indian-owned or operated aircraft, including military flights.This affects Indian flights to the Gulf, Europe, and the US, increasing travel time, with higher fuel costs, and fare hikes.
• Closure of Wagah Border:Pakistan has sealed its side of theWagah borderpost as well.
• Diplomatic Downsizing:The strength of India's High Commission in Islamabad will be reduced to 30 members, with the expulsion of Indian defence officials.
• SAARC visa Cancellations:All SAARC visas for Indian nationals have been cancelled, except for Sikh pilgrims, for whom theKartarpur Corridorwill remain open.

• India-Pakistan trade had shown signs of recovery, reaching USD 1.2 billion in 2024, a 127% increase from 2023. Suspension reverses these gains.

• This affects Indian flights to the Gulf, Europe, and the US, increasing travel time, with higher fuel costs, and fare hikes.


What are the Potential Geopolitical Factors Behind Pakistan's Pahalgam Attack?


• India’s Kashmir Policy:Pakistan views India's revocation ofArticle 370 in 2019and Kashmir's integration as a challenge to its self-claimed sovereignty due to its illegal occupation over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan's increasing marginalization andIndia's success in stabilizing Kashmirmay have pushed Pakistan to resort to violence to reassert its position in the region.
• International Isolation: Pakistan’s traditional allies like theUS, Gulf states, and even Chinaare distancing themselves due to Islamabad’s declining reliability and returns.Additionally, theUS withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021,Pakistan's strategic importance to the US has sharply declined, leaving it diplomatically isolated.
• Economic Collapse: A crumbling economy, soaringinflation,and weak state institutions have left Pakistan increasingly unstable.RisingBaloch insurgencyand persistent terror activities along Pakistan’s western front have made the country less appealing to foreign investors, worsening its economic troubles and hindering prospects for recovery.
• Global Geopolitical Messaging: The timing of the Pahalgam attack, coinciding withPM Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabiaand theUS Vice President’s trip to India, suggests Pakistan is asserting its regional power and signaling its continued influence in South Asia.Despite global condemnation, Pakistan may see international attention as an opportunity tore-engage diplomaticallyamid its growing isolation.

What is the Significance of the Indus Waters Treaty?


• Indus Waters Treaty:The IWT, signed in 1960 in Karachi after nine years of negotiations betweenIndia and Pakistan, was mediated by theWorld Bank.The treaty allocates the"Eastern Rivers" of the Indus system(Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej) to India for unrestricted use, while the"Western Rivers"(Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab) are reserved for Pakistan, effectively givingPakistan access to about 80% of the total water.India is allowed limitednon-consumptive uses of the Western Rivers, such as for navigation, agriculture, and hydroelectricity, subject to design and operational conditions under the treaty.IWT established aPermanent Indus Commission (PIC)to ensure annual dialogue and cooperation, and laid out athree-tier dispute resolution mechanism,including resolution at the PIC level, through aNeutral Expert(appointed by the World Bank or jointly by the India and Pakistan),or if needed, aCourt of Arbitration.
• Actions Regarding IWT:In 2023, India issued its first notice under the IWT, requesting modifications to the Treaty, focusing on theKishengangaandRatlehydroelectric projects.Despite these projects being classified as"run-of-the-river"and intended togenerate electricitywithout obstructing thenatural river flow, Pakistan raised concerns, claiming they violate the IWT’s stipulations.India responded with another notice in 2024, seeking a review and modification of the IWT.Article XII (3) of the IWTallows for modifications to the Treaty through a duly ratified agreement between the two governments.
• India’s Suspension of the IWT:India’s suspension marks the first suspension of the treaty since its inception, signaling ashift in water diplomacy linked to cross-border terrorism.Article 62 of the Vienna Conventionallows a country to withdraw from or repudiate a treaty if there is a fundamental change in circumstances that makes the continuation of the treaty untenable.
• Implications of IWT Suspension:India:Suspension of the IWT gives India greater flexibility in managing the Indus river system.India can now carry outreservoir flushingon projects like Kishanganga (Jhelum) without waiting for the peak monsoon period, as previously mandated by the treaty. This will help in increasing thelife of the Kishenganga dam.India can fast-track hydroelectric projects on western rivers, bypassing design and operational restrictions, and halt Pakistani inspections at ongoing projects likeKishenganga and Ratle (on Chenab).However, the suspension won’t immediately affect Pakistan’s water supply, asIndia lacks the infrastructure to fully control or divert the flow at this stage.Pakistan:The suspension of the IWT threatens Pakistan's water security, as80% of its cultivated land relies on these rivers.Disruption could impactfood security,urban water supply, and power generation, while also causing economic instability due to the Indus system's contribution to25% of Pakistan's GDP.India's ability to withhold river flow data further compounds Pakistan's vulnerability, hinderingflood preparedness and water resource management.Pakistan may pursue arbitration, seek World Bank aid, and rally allies like China to negotiate favorable terms with India, but economic constraints may limit strong retaliation.

Note: Reservoir flushing is a technique used to removeaccumulated sediment from reservoirsby releasing water through low-level outlets to scour out the sediment and transport it downstream.


India’s Key Dams on the Indus System


• Kishanganga (Jhelum): Operational since 2018, diverts water from a key tributary of the Mangla Dam.
• Ratle (Chenab): Under construction, may further reduce flows to Pakistan's Punjab region.
• Shahpurkandi (Ravi): Redirects Ravi water to Indian channels, reducing Pakistan's access.
• Ujh (Ravi): A planned dam that will decrease downstream water availability to Pakistan.


What Should Be India’s Long-Term Strategy Toward Pakistan?


• Strengthening Deterrence:India must maintain a strong military presence along the border, modernizing its forces withHigh Tech Border Surveillance System, andsmart fencing.A credible deterrent, including robust border security, can prevent Pakistan from escalating tensions, particularly over Kashmir or potential military incursions
• Utilizing UN Security Council:India should persist in highlighting Pakistan’s support for terrorist groups at theUN Security Council,emphasizing global condemnation.India should leverageArticle 51 of the UN Charter,which calls for collective action against terrorism, to mobilize global support for greater sanctions on Pakistan.Additionally, India should advocate for Pakistan’s inclusion in theFinancial Action Task Force (FATF)blacklist for its involvement in terror financing, to pressure Pakistan into compliance.
• Internal Resilience and Social Cohesion:India must adopt a proactivecounter-radicalization strategy,focusing on vulnerable border regions.This involves not just security measures, but also fostering unity through public awareness campaigns thatemphasize peace, pluralism, and national cohesion.

How is AI Forecasting Different from Traditional Forecasting Methods?


Traditional Methods (Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP))

Data-Driven vs. Physics-Based

AI models use large datasets to detect patterns and correlations without understanding physical processes, such as atmospheric interactions, uncovering hidden connections.

Traditional models use physical equations on fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to simulate the atmosphere.

Computational Approach

AI enhances real-time forecasting by evolving algorithms and detecting subtle patterns.

NWP models need supercomputers for complex, time-consuming calculations, especially in long-term forecasts.

Flexibility and Adaptability

AI adapts to new data, handles diverse inputs (e.g., ocean salinity), and adjusts to different geographical conditions.

NWP models rely on fixed rules, making them less flexible and requiring updates for extreme events.

Prediction of Extreme Events

AI predicts extreme events like heatwaves and floods more accurately and earlier by analyzing large datasets.

NWP is good for general weather but struggles with localized extreme events.


What are the Challenges with AI-based Forecasting?


• Data Quality and Availability: AI modelsneed large, high-quality datasets,but weather data isoften inconsistent, sparse, or inaccurate,especially in remote areas.
• Complex Weather Systems: Weather systems arechaotic and nonlinear, making it difficult for AI to predict them accurately. Regional variability adds further complexity.
• Interpretability: AI models often act as “black boxes,” meaning their predictions are hard to explain, leading to trust issues among non-experts.
• Lack of Expertise: AI-based forecasting requirescross-disciplinary expertisein bothclimate science and machine learning,which is scarce in India.
• Limited Computational Infrastructure:AI models require significant computing power, especially for high-resolution forecasts.Many Indian institutions still lack the necessary infrastructure, such as high-performance GPUs, to support AI-based weather prediction.
• Bias and Trust Issues: AI models are often criticized for their "black-box" nature, making it difficult to interpret how predictions are made.AI models may inherit biases from the data they’re trained on, leading to unreliable predictions, and public trust in AI-based forecasts is a concern.

• AI models may inherit biases from the data they’re trained on, leading to unreliable predictions, and public trust in AI-based forecasts is a concern.


What Measures Can Improve the Effectiveness of AI-Based Weather Forecasting in India?


• Hybrid Approach:Combining AI/ML with traditional physics-based models creates hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both.This approach enhances forecast accuracy, especially for complex weather patterns, by fusing data-driven insights with physical atmospheric principles.
• Crowdsourcing for Localized Data Collection:Leveraging platforms likeGoogle Maps,andGoogle DeepMind's GenCast AI model, citizens can contribute localized weather data, aiding real-time feedback for AI models to refine predictions.Integrating this data intoapps likeMausamenhances community-driven forecasting, improving accuracy for extreme weather events.
• Expanding Ground Station Networks:ExpandingAutomatic Weather Stations (AWS) and Automatic Rain Gauges (ARG)networks through initiatives likeWINDS(which aims to create 200,000+ new stations) will strengthen data for AI models.Tapping into private sector networks and ensuring seamless integration can further boost forecasting accuracy.
• Global Collaboration:India can accelerate AI-based weather forecasting by collaborating with global leaders like Google, andNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)on joint projects and shared datasets.Establishing AI/ML and Climate Science Institutes will foster interdisciplinary expertise, supported by the DST and MoES.Hosting annual AI in Weather Forecasting Conferences and offering training programs will ensure a continuous supply of skilled professionals.
