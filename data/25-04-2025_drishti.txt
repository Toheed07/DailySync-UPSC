For Mains:Indo-Pakistan Bilateral Relations,  Strategic implications of Pakistan suspending the Simla Agreement, India’s nuclear doctrine and strategic autonomy


Why in News?


Following India’s response to thePahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir,Pakistan announced that it would place theSimla Agreement of 1972in abeyance.

• This decision has raised concerns about the future of peace and stability in the region, especially regarding theLine of Control (LoC)in Jammu and Kashmir.


What is the Simla Agreement?


• About:The Simla Agreement was a bilateral treaty signed on2ndJuly 1972in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, between Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.It came in the aftermath of the1971 India-Pakistan war,which led to the creation ofBangladesh(formerly East Pakistan) and a decisive Indian military victory.The accord aimed to normalize relations, end hostilities, and create a blueprint for peaceful coexistence and bilateralism.
• Key Provisions:Reference to UN Charter:The principles and purposes of theUnited Nations Charterwere outlined to govern bilateral relations between India and Pakistan.It countered previous UN resolutions (like UNSC Resolution 47) that called for aplebiscite in Kashmir.Peaceful settlement of disputes:Both nations pledged to resolve all disputes, including Kashmir,bilaterally without third-party intervention.Respect for sovereignty:The countries agreed to respect each other’s territorial integrity, political independence, and non-interference in internal affairs.Redrawing of the ceasefire line:The 1971 ceasefire line in Jammu and Kashmir wasre-designatedas theLine of Control (LoC), with both sides committing not to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of differences.Normalization of diplomatic ties:The agreement called for resuming communications, travel, and trade links, aiming to restore diplomatic and economic relations.Release of prisoners of war:India agreed to release over 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, one of the largest post-war releases in history.

• Release of prisoners of war:India agreed to release over 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, one of the largest post-war releases in history.

• It countered previous UN resolutions (like UNSC Resolution 47) that called for aplebiscite in Kashmir.

Note:While the Simla Agreement aimed to resolve the Kashmir issue, it fell short of addressing theregion's broader political status.The LoC, instead of being a temporary measure, became ade facto border,leaving the core dispute unresolved. Additionally, the absence of a strongenforcement mechanismhas led to recurring violations.


What are the Potential Implications of Suspension of the Simla Agreement?


• Shift from Bilateralism to Internationalization:With the bilateral framework of theSimla Agreement in abeyance,there might be calls for international mediation or intervention in resolving disputes.Pakistan may seek third-party involvement, such as the UN, or allies like China, or theOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to internationalize the Kashmir conflict, contravening the Simla Agreement.
• Proxy Warfare Risks:Pakistan has previously violated the agreement (e.g., the1984 Siachen incursion,1999 Kargil War).The suspension could potentially reviveproxy warfare tacticsthat the Simla framework aimed to curb.
• Increased Diplomatic and Military Tensions: The suspension of the Simla Agreement may not have immediate tactical consequences, but could open the door togreater diplomatic and military brinkmanship.Any revival of hostilities or border instability can derail developmental and democratic consolidation efforts in J&K postArticle 370 abrogation.The potential for conflict between two nuclear-armed states raises alarms in the international community, prompting calls for restraint and dialogue.
• Influence on Multilateral Cooperation:The breakdown in bilateral agreements may affect cooperation in regional organizations likeSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),hindering collective efforts on issues like counter-terrorism and economic development.

• Pakistan may seek third-party involvement, such as the UN, or allies like China, or theOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to internationalize the Kashmir conflict, contravening the Simla Agreement.

• The suspension could potentially reviveproxy warfare tacticsthat the Simla framework aimed to curb.

• Any revival of hostilities or border instability can derail developmental and democratic consolidation efforts in J&K postArticle 370 abrogation.
• The potential for conflict between two nuclear-armed states raises alarms in the international community, prompting calls for restraint and dialogue.


What Measures Should India Adopt to Tighten Security Along the LoC?


• Deployment of Anti-Drone Defense Systems:Install anti-drone radars andArtificial Intelligence (AI)based detection systems to counter growing drone-based smuggling and surveillance along the LoC. Collaborate withIsraeli "Drone Dome"technology for enhanced response capabilities.
• Enhanced Surveillance Using Satellite and UAV Technologies:Integrate real-time satellite imagery,unmanned aerial vehicles patrols (like Heron TP drones),and ground-based radar data for seamless 24x7 monitoring.Employ AI-driven analytics to detect unusual movements or tunnel activities.
• Strengthening Counter-Infiltration Grids:Refine multi-layered counter-infiltration grids involving army,Border Security Force (BSF),local police, and intelligence units.Regularly revise SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) based on seasonal changes and enemy tactics.
• Community Engagement and Village Defence Committees (VDCs):Revive andempower Village Defence Committees(especially in Anantnag) with proper arms training, intelligence gathering roles, and early warning systems.Foster community-police-military collaboration to build a“first line of alert.”
• Comprehensive Border Fencing Modernization:As a long term measure, there is a need to replace traditionalbarbed-wire fenceswithsmart fencesequipped with infrared sensors, laser walls, and seismic detectors under projects likeComprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS).Accelerate fencing in vulnerable sectors such asGurez, Uri, and Poonch,where infiltration routes are active.

• Employ AI-driven analytics to detect unusual movements or tunnel activities.

Conclusion


The suspension of the Simla Agreement provides India an opportunity to recalibrate its security and diplomatic strategies. Strengthening LoC defences and international alliances is crucial. India can leverage this incident to highlight Pakistan’s role in terror financing. It also strengthens the case for Pakistan’s re-listing in theFinancial Action Task Forcegrey list.

Drishti Mains Question:

Critically analyze the significance of the Simla Agreement in shaping post-1971 India-Pakistan relations. What could be the implications of its suspension?

Why in News?


TheIndian Meteorological Department(IMD)in its first forecast for 2025 has forecasted anabove-normal monsoon for 2025which will support agricultural output and aid the government’s efforts to containfood inflation,which is highly sensitive to rainfall variability.


What is IMD's Forecast on Monsoons for 2025?


• Rainfall Prediction:IMD has forecast an“above normal”southwest monsoonin 2025, with rainfall likely at105% of the Long Period Average (87 cm), ±5% margin.IMD classifies monsoon rainfall as:Deficient (<90% of LPA), Below Normal (90–95%),Normal (96–104%),Above Normal (105–110%),andExcess (>110%).This is backed by neutralEl Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)andIndian Ocean Dipole (IOD)conditions andbelow-normal snow cover over Eurasia,which supports stronger monsoons.IMD’sforecast accuracy has improved,withaverage deviation reducingto 2.27% (2021–25) from 7.5% (2017–20).
• Geographic Distribution:The IMD forecast predictsbelow normal rainfallin parts ofJammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, and the Northeast.While, it forcastsnormal to above normalrainfall inMadhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengalwhich form thecore monsoon zone (agriculture primarily rain-fed)of the country.

What is the Impact of Monsoons on Food Inflation in India?


• Agricultural Yield and Crop Prices: Monsoonsimpactagricultural output and food prices,but theeffect is not always direct.Whilegood monsoons generally improve yieldsand lower prices,certain crops may still face price hikesdue to production issues.Over the last 10 years (2015-24), rainfall has beennormal or above averagein 6 out of 10 years. In years withlower rainfall,such as FY16 and FY19,agricultural growth was weak(at just 0.65% in FY18 and 2.7% in FY24),averaging4.45% over the decade.

• Supply Chain Disruptions and Transportation Costs:Heavy monsoons often disrupt transport and supply chains,raising logistics and storage costs. For example, the2023 floods in Assamand Bihar delayed staple movement, causingtemporary price spikes.
• Monsoon Deficit and Import Inflation:Monsoon failureraises import dependency,especially forpulses and edible oils, adding to inflation. In 2023, poor rains led toincreased edible oil imports from Indonesia and Malaysia. In 2022-23, India imported 16.5 MT of edible oils, with domestic production fulfilling only 40-45% of the country's requirements.

Beyond Rainfall: Key Drivers of Food Inflation


• Despitehigh rainfallin FY20, FY21, FY23, and FY25 (over 100% of LPA),food inflation remained high (6–7%).In contrast, during below-normal rainfall years like FY18 and FY19,food inflation was low (2.2% and 0.7%).This indicates thatrainfall alone doesn't drive food inflation.
• Notably,food inflation droppedfromover 8% in Dec 2024 to below 6% in Jan 2025,and fell belowheadline inflationby March 2025, for the first time since July 2023.

• This indicates thatrainfall alone doesn't drive food inflation.


What are the Other Key Factors Affecting Food Inflation in India?


• Supply Shocks: Factors likehoarding and market disruptionsalso contribute to price hikes, even if rainfall is good.
• Global Commodity Prices:Rising global prices of key importslike edible oils and pulsesraise domestic costs.India’s dependence on imports makes it vulnerable toglobal market fluctuations,directly impacting food inflation.
• Monetary Policy: When theRBI increases interest rates,borrowing becomes costlier for producers.Thisraises production costs,especially for packaged foods, leading to higher consumer prices.
• Government Policies:Changes in Minimum Support Prices (MSPs)support farmers butcan raise market prices.Export restrictions may protect local supply but also disrupt global trade and push up domestic prices.
• Supply Chain Disruptions:Weak storage infrastructure and transport delayslead towastage and higher food prices. Efficient logistics are crucial to keeping food inflation under control.

• Export restrictions may protect local supply but also disrupt global trade and push up domestic prices.


What is the Current Status of Food Inflation in India?


• Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI)which measuresIndia’s food inflation increasedfrom 7.5% in FY24 to8.4% in FY25,primarily due to price rise invegetables and pulses,exacerbated by extreme weather events.Excludingprice-sensitive vegetables (Tomato, Onion, Potato)from CPI basket,average food inflation in FY25 was 6.5%.

• Excludingprice-sensitive vegetables (Tomato, Onion, Potato)from CPI basket,average food inflation in FY25 was 6.5%.


What Steps should India take to Control Food Inflation?


• Improved Supply Chain Management:Strengthening logistics, storage,anddistributioncan reduce wastage and ensure a steady food supply.Using refrigerated trucks for perishables helpsminimize spoilage and maintain fresh produce availability.
• Promoting Agri-Tech for Inflation Control:Encouraging theuse of technologieslikeprecision farming, drones, and AI-driven crop management canboost productivityandreduce input costs, helping stabilize food prices.Techniques likedrip irrigationimprove productivity in water-scarce areas, whiledrought-resistant varietieshelp prevent crop failures during water shortages.Additionally, tools likeAmbiTaghelp reduce food wastage bymonitoring transit temperaturesandproviding real-time alerts,ensuringbetter preservation and supply chain efficiency.
• Agricultural Diversification:Encouraging farmers togrow diverse crops reduces dependenceon a few commodities.Promoting pulsesalongside rice and wheatimproves soil fertility,providesalternative income, and mitigates risksfrom fluctuating monsoon conditions.
• Reforming Food Subsidy SystemsImproving thePublic Distribution System (PDS)throughbetter targeting, reduced leakages, andexpanded coveragecan help ease food inflation. Using technology fortransparent and efficient subsidydelivery ensures affordability for the poor without straining fiscal resources.
• Towards Climate Resilience:Climate-smart practices such asrainwater harvesting, crop rotation,andclimate-resilient seedshelp farmers adapt to erratic monsoons. A key step in this direction is the release of109 climate-resilient crop varieties, aimed at stabilizing yields and reducing weather-related losses.

World Malaria Day, observed on25thAprilannually, was established by theWorld Health Organization (WHO)in 2007 to raise awareness and drive action against malaria.

• Thetheme for World Malaria Day 2025is“Malaria Ends With Us: Reinvest, Reimagine, Reignite”


What are the Key Facts Regarding Malaria?


• About:Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by thePlasmodium parasite,transmitted to humans by infectedfemale Anopheles mosquitoes.It is common intropical and subtropical regionsof the world such assub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America.There are5 Plasmodium speciesthat cause malaria in humans.P. falciparumis thedeadliestwhileP. vivax isthe most widespread.The other species areP. malariae,P. ovale, andP. knowlesi.Themosquito becomes infected after biting an infected person. The malaria parasites then enter the bloodstream of the next person the mosquito bites.The parasites travel to the liver, mature, and then infectred blood cells.
• Symptoms:It includesfever, chills, headache, and fatigue,and severe cases can lead toorgan failure or death.Notably,malaria is both preventable and curable.
• Burden:As per theWorld Malaria Report 2024, In India, between 2015 and 2023, malaria cases declined from11.69 lakh to 2.27 lakh, and deaths reduced from384 to 83, marking an80% declinein both indicators.In2024, India exited WHO’sHigh Burden to High Impact (HBHI)list, a major milestone in malaria elimination and its vision to achieve malaria-free status by 2030.Globally, Malaria remains amajor health challenge, affecting263 million peopleand killing over600,000 annually.Africa bears 94–95%of the global malaria burden (WHO, 2024).
• Treatment & Prevention:Treatment: Advanced with effective drugs likechloroquineandartemisinin, supported by tools likeinsecticide-treated nets (ITNs)andindoor spraying.In 2015, Youyou Tu was awarded theNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicinefor her discovery ofartemisinin,which is derived from thesweet wormwood plant, Artemisia annua.Vaccines:RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix), approved by WHO in 2021, is the first malaria vaccine for children (5 months+).In 2023,R21/Matrix-Mwas approved as a second safe and effective vaccine.Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs): These nets are treated with insecticide, acting as both aphysical and chemical barrieragainst mosquitoes.Chemoprophylaxis: Involves taking antimalarial drugsbefore, during, and after travelto endemic areas to prevent infection.Preventive Chemotherapy: Targeted administration of antimalarials tovulnerable groups(children, pregnant women) during high-risk periods.Key strategies includeSeasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), Perennial Malaria Chemoprevention (PMC), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp),Mass Drug Administration (MDA) etc.Duringpregnancy, intermittent preventive treatment withsulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP)is recommended at every scheduledantenatal care visit, starting from the second trimester, in areas with moderate to high malaria transmission to help prevent infection.

Note:


• Female Anopheles mosquitoes are not true parasitesas they donot depend entirely on a host for survival. While they require a blood meal to develop eggs, theirprimary energy source is plant nectar,unlike parasites which fully rely on the host for sustenance.


Malaria: A Global Disease with Historic Consequences


• The word “malaria” comes from Italian“mala aria”(bad air), once believed to be its cause.In1880, French physicianCharles Louis Alphonse Laverandiscovered the protozoan parasitePlasmodiumas thecause of malariaLater,Ronald Ross(1897) proved transmission throughAnopheles mosquitoes, completing the disease cycle by1898.
• This scientific breakthrough helped European colonists survive in Africa, leading to theScramble for Africaafter theBerlin Conference (1884).Quinine, mosquito nets, and swamp drainage reduced malaria deaths, enabling colonisation—by1914, Europeans controlled90% of Africa.
• Malaria also shaped thetrans-Atlantic slave trade, as Africans with genetic resistance were preferred labour in malaria-endemic colonies like the Caribbean and Americas.This contributed toracialised labour systemsand long-term social inequality.

The turmoil over regional trade policies and proliferatingFree Trade Agreements (FTAs)reignited discussions on theSpaghetti bowl phenomenon.

• According to theWorld Bank,the Spaghetti Bowl Phenomenon refers to the confusing and overlapping network ofmultiple FTAs between countries,which end up complicating trade instead of facilitating it.As each FTA comes with its own set ofRules of Origin (ROO),which makes it challenging for producers to meet the varied criteria when trading across multiple FTAs.The term"Spaghetti Bowl Phenomenon"was coined byJagdish Bhagwati in 1995,where he criticized FTAs for being counterproductive, complicating global trade rather than promoting openness.The“spaghetti”metaphor compares the tangle of trade rules to a bowl of spaghetti (messy and hard to navigate).
• Impact:Despite more FTAs, trade volumes between regions (like South Asia and East Asia) often remain stagnant due to this complexity.

DuringOperation Brahma, theIndian Air Forceclaimed that its transportaircraft delivering relief toquake-hit MyanmarfacedGlobal Positioning System (GPS)spoofing.

• Under‘Operation Brahma’, India deployed six military transport aircraft to deliver humanitarian aid, field hospitals, and rescue teams to earthquake-hit Myanmar.
• GPS Spoofing (GPS Simulation):It is a form ofcyberattackin whichfalse GPS signals are generatedtomislead an aircraft’s navigation systems, posing serious risks to flight safety and mission success.GPS spoofing takes advantage of the weak signals sent by satellites, which are easy to overpower.Attackers transmit stronger,fake signals that mimic real satellite data.TheGPS receiver locks onto these counterfeit signals, mistaking them for genuine.This causes the device todisplay incorrect location data, misleading navigation systems.
• Risk:It can hijack planes, redirecting them to unintended locations, posing security risks.It can alsodisrupt military operations,causing misdirected forces andfriendly fire.
• Mitigation:Tomitigate GPS spoofing risks,multi-constellation systems, advanced signal processing, and anti-spoofing devicescan enhance security.
