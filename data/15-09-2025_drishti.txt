TheMinistry of New and Renewable Energyis formulating a plan to create a fullyindigenous solar manufacturing ecosystemby 2028, encompassingmodules, cells, wafers, and ingots.


What is the Solar Manufacturing Value Chain?


• About:Thesolar manufacturing value chainencompasses the complete process of convertingraw materialsinto a fully functionalsolar photovoltaic (PV) module.It is a sequential workflow and the chain is generally divided intoUpstream(high-tech, capital-intensive) andDownstream(labor-intensive) segments.
• Key Stages:Upstream Manufacturing (The Core Components):Polysilicon:The process begins withmetallurgical-grade siliconderived fromquartz sand, which is then processed intopolysilicon.Ingots:Thepolysiliconis melted and crystallized into large, cylindricalblockscalledingots.Wafers:Ingotsare sliced intoultra-thin, disc-shapedsheetsusing awire saw. Thesesheets, calledwafers, are the fundamentalbuilding blockof asolar cell.Solar Cell:Thewafersundergodoping(adding phosphorus and boron to form an electric field),printing(metal contacts for electron flow), andanti-reflective coatingto minimize light reflection. The result is asolar cellcapable of converting sunlight intoelectricity.Downstream Manufacturing (Assembly & Installation):Module Manufacturing:Solar cells are interconnected, laminated, sealed betweenglassandpolymer back sheets, and framed to form asolar module.System Installation & Integration:Modules are assembled into arrays, connected toinverters, mounting structures, and wiring, and installed onrooftops, fields, or solar farms.
• Current Status:India'ssolar module capacityhas already touched100 GW, butsolar cell capacityis only27 GW, whileingot and wafer capacity is just 2.2 GW,making it heavily reliant on imports, particularly from China.Indiaaimsto finalize aroadmap for Swadeshi polysilicon productionin the coming years.
• Proposed Reforms:A key step is the proposed expansion of theApproved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM),currently for modules, to includesolar cells, wafers, and ingots.ALMM mandates that solar project developers purchase equipment from approved models and manufacturers, promotingdomestic manufacturingand acting as anon-tariff barrierto low-quality or import-dependent products.

What are the Challenges in Developing the Indigenous Solar Value Chain?


• H – High-Cost & Scale Issues:Indian-made components are initiallyexpensiveand less competitive due todis-economies of scale (business's cost per unit increases instead of decreasing as it expands production).
• U – Upstream Infrastructure Gaps:Polysilicon and wafer manufacturingistechnology-intensiveand capital-heavy, with limited domestic experience.
• R – RoW & Land Bottlenecks:Land acquisitionandRight of Way (RoW)issues block projects.
• D – Delayed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs):Procurement delays byStates/Discomshurt project viability.
• L – Lack of Experience:Limited experience in advancedsolar manufacturing.
• E – Export/Import Dependence:Reliance onimportsincreases vulnerability.


Achievements in Solar Energy


• Renewable Energy:India surpasses251.5 GW non-fossil energy capacity, achieving overhalf of its 2030 target of 500 GW.
• PM Suryaghar Yojana:India has already installed20 lakh rooftop solar projects under thePM Suryaghar Yojana, with expectations to cross50 lakh installations soon.
• PM-KUSUM scheme:Under thePM-KUSUM scheme, over1.6 million solar pumpshave been installed or solarised, reducingdiesel useby1.3 billion litres annuallyand cuttingCO2 emissionsby40 million tonnes.


What Steps are Needed to Develop a Indigenous Solar Value Chain in India?


• Mnemonic: SHINE
• S – Sustained Policy Support: ExpandALMM, ensure stablePLI, phasedcustoms duties, and cleartechnology acquisitionplans.
• H – Harness Investment: BuildGreenfield manufacturing, providecapital support, and resolveland/RoWissues.
• I – Innovation & R&D: Promotenext-generation technologieslikePerovskiteand strengthenancillary industries.
• N – Navigate Coordination: Streamlinestate-level execution, ensureDiscom financial stability, and align with schemes likePM Suryaghar YojanaandPM-KUSUM.
• E – Expand Demand: Drivedomestic solar manufacturing demandthrough policy and deployment programs.


Conclusion


India’sgreen energy transitionis crucial to achievingnet-zero by 2070, with targets of1,800 GW renewable capacity by 2047and5,000 GW by 2070. An integrated roadmap is needed: developdomestic solar manufacturing, resolveland and RoW bottlenecks, fast-trackPPA signings, and institutionalizeALMMforwafers, ingots, and polysilicon, enhancingenergy security, sustainability, and India’sglobal solar leadership.

Adivasis from theHo tribe in Jharkhand’s Kolhan regionprotested against allegedadministrative interference in the Manki-Munda system, with tensions driven by vacant posts, hereditary inefficiencies, and calls for reforms.


What is the Manki-Munda System?


• Manki-Munda System:It is a centuries-oldself-governance framework of the Ho adivasi community.Each village is led by ahereditary Munda, responsible for resolving local disputes, while a group of8–15 villages, called a pidh, is overseen by aManki, handling cases unresolved at the village level.The system isdecentralized and purely socio-political,with no role inrevenue collection, land management, or taxation.
• British Intervention: Post-Battle of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), East India Company gaineddiwani rights,introducing taxation.Permanent Settlement Act (1793)forced zamindars to extract land revenue, seizing Ho lands, triggeringHo (1821–22) and Kol (1831) revolts.To manage the region, the British co-opted the Manki-Munda system instead of suppressing it.Captain Thomas Wilkinson (1833)codified the system inWilkinson’s Rules,formally recognising Mundas and Mankis and integrating them into colonial administration.This introducedprivate property and pattas,transforming collective landholding to individual ownership and led to demographic changes with influx ofoutsiders (dikkus).
• Post-Independence:Kolhan largely retainedWilkinson’s Rules,with courts recognizing them as valid customary practices untilMora Ho vs State of Bihar (2000),in which the Patna High Court clarified they arecustoms, not formal law, but allowed continued practice.2021 Jharkhand initiative (Nyay Manch)proposed reform, but not enacted.

The Prime Minister inaugurated India’s firstbamboo-basedbioethanolplantin Golaghat, Assam, marking a major step towardenergy self-sufficiency and green energy promotion.

• Economic Impact:Bioethanol plant will source5 lakh tonnes of bamboo annuallyfrom Assam and other northeastern states.The project willbenefit local farmers and tribal communities, providing aRs 200-crore boostto Assam’s rural economy.After the amendment to theIndian Forest Act, 1927,bamboo is no longer classified as a tree,lifting the ban on its cutting. This change supports thelivelihoods of forest communitiesand private growers.It aligns withIndia’s Viksit Bharat vision, focusing onhydrocarbonexploration andgreen energy initiatives, and aims to reduce dependence onfossil fuels.
• Bioethanol:It is a high-octane biofuel (C2H5OH) producedbiologically from biomass like corn, sugarcane, grains, bamboo and vegetable residues.It is mainly used as agasoline additive, with engines now capable of burning pure ethanol.Key production steps include fermentation of sugars, pretreatment ofstarch or cellulose, distillation,and dehydration to fuel-grade ethanol.

India is turning toContracts for Difference (CfD)as a central mechanism to mobilize nearlyUSD 1 trillion ingreen financefor its 500 GW renewable energy target by 2030.

• CfD is a financial agreement betweenrenewable energy producers and the government to stabilize revenues. If market prices fall below an agreed strike price, the government pays the producer the difference and if prices rise above it, the producer returns the surplus.CfDs reduce risk and are widely used in Europe for renewable projects.
• Green financeencompasses financial products and services designed to promote environmental sustainability. To meet itsParis Agreement targets,India needsUSD 2.5 trillion by 2030.
