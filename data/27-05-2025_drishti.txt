Why in News?


The Prime Minister at the“Rising Northeast: The Investor Summit”declared that theNortheast Region (NER) of Indiais no longer a “frontier” but a “frontrunner” in India’s growth journey. Highlighting its strategic importance and economic potential, he emphasized the region’s evolving role as a gateway for trade withSoutheast Asia.

Note:TheMinistry of Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER)is organizing theRising Northeast Summit to unlock the investment and trade potential of the NER of India.

• The initiative aims to project NER as a dynamic economic corridor with strategic connectivity to ASEAN and BBN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal) countries.
• Rising North East Investors Summit 2025 drew anunprecedented Rs 4.3 lakh crore in investment interest,setting the stage for the NER to become India’s next economic powerhouse.


How is the Northeast Emerging as a ‘Frontrunner’ for India’s Growth?


• Bio-economy and Natural Resources:The NER, referred to as‘Ashta Lakshmis’,highlights the region’s vast potential in renewable energy, agro-based industries, eco-tourism, and strategic manufacturing.The region’s biodiversity is being leveraged forgreen growth. Assam is a major hub fortea production, while Arunachal Pradesh leads inbamboo-based industries.The region holds40% of India’s hydropower potential (~62,000 MW), yet only 6.9% is harnessed. Solar potential is estimated at57,360 MW with only 17% installed capacity.
• Tourism and Human Capital Strengths:The Northeast's natural beauty and vibrant culture make it a perfect destination for eco-friendly and sustainable tourism.Key attractions includeMeghalaya’s living root bridges,Sikkim’s eco-tourism,Kaziranga National Park, andKamakhya Templein Assam, andManipur’s Loktak Lake.These sites boost local livelihoods and promote eco-friendly travel.Additionally, high literacy rates among NER (~80%) and a high proportion of English-speaking populations contribute to the region’s workforce readiness.States like Manipur and Mizoram are national leaders in sports like football, boxing, and weightlifting.
• Gateway to Southeast Asia:The Northeast is central toIndia's Act East Policy,serving as a bridge to ASEAN and Indo-Pacific markets.Projects like theIndia-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highwayand the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Projectare enhancing regional connectivity.Development of ports likeSittwe in Myanmar and Chittagong in Bangladeshwill connect Northeast India to key Indian Ocean shipping routes, boosting India-ASEAN trade fromUSD 125 billion to USD 200 billion over the next decade.
• Critical to National Security: NER shares 5,484 km of borders with five countries(Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet/China)plays a frontline role in national security.TheSiliguri Corridor (Chicken’s Neck),is a vitalstrategic and economic lifeline,connecting Northeast India to the rest of the country and serving as a key transit hub for trade with Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
• Infrastructure Push:The central government has significantly increased funding with 10% of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ budget allocated to the Northeast.TheNorth East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS),launched in 2018, has a USD 1 billion allocation for roads, water, and power.Projects like theSela Tunnelin Arunachal Pradeshare improving all-weather connectivity to remote areas. New initiatives like the upcomingSemiconductorPlant in Assammark a shift toward high-tech industrial investment.

Mechanical devicesthatcollect oil from the water surfacefor safe disposal or recycling; effective when deployed quickly.

Theyabsorb or adsorboil from water  and are particularly useful for small spills or residual oilafter primary cleanup.

Natural sorbents (Straw, Volcanic ash), Synthetic (Polyester-derived plastic shavings).

Surfactant-based chemicals thatbreak oil into dropletsforfaster biodegradation. It is effective but may harm marine life due to itspotential toxicity.


What are the Legal and Institutional Frameworks on Oil Pollution Control?


• Indian Legal Framework:Merchant Shipping Act, 1958:Serves as theprimary maritime legislation. Incorporates provisions of theInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships(MARPOL) Conventiontoregulate ship-borne pollution,including oil discharges.National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan (NOS-DCP), 1993:Implemented by the Indian Coast Guard,as a keyframework for coordinated oil spill response.Thoughnot legally binding, it ensurestimely and integrated actionamong stakeholders.National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010:NGTprovides a judicial mechanism for swift adjudication of environmental disputes, including marine pollution, and awards compensation for damages.
• International Frameworks:Bunker Oil Convention (2001): Ratified by India in 2015under theIMO, this conventionensures prompt and adequate compensationfordamage caused by fuel oil spills from ships’ bunkers,protecting those affected by such pollution incidents.MARPOL 73/78 (Annex I): India is a party to thiskey international conventionaimed atpreventing marine pollution from ships, covering bothoperational discharges and accidental oil spills.Civil Liability Convention (CLC), 1969 & International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPC), 1992:Establishliability and compensation mechanisms for oil spill damage. Facilitatefinancial recovery and legal recourse for victimsand governments in the event of tanker spills.

TheIndia Meteorological Department (IMD)is set to adopt the indigenously developedBharat Forecast System (BFS), India’s first high-resolution weather model capable of forecasting at a 6 km x 6 km spatial resolution.

• Bharat Forecast System (BFS)has been developed by theIndian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, and will beoperationalised by IMD.
• BFS significantlyimproves upon IMD’s existing resolution of 12 km x 12 km, allowing formore accurate detection of localised extreme weather events, such ascloudburstsandflash floods.Thecurrent limitation of a 144 sq km unit of analysiswill be reduced to 36 sq km, enabling better micro-level weather predictions.
• The BFS model is expected to enhanceforecasting precisionforcyclones, heavy rainfall, and monsoon variability, especially at the district and sub-district levels.
• The BFS has beentested in experimental mode since 2022and is now being scaled for nationwide operational use withhigh-performance computing support.
• Currently, IMD uses theCoupled Forecasting System (CFS),developed under theMonsoon Missionand adapted from a US-based model for Indian monsoon forecasting.It also operates theGlobal Forecasting System (GFS),a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, for forecasts ranging from hours to seasonal scales.
