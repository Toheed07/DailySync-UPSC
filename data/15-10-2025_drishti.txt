What are the Key Challenges in India’s Deep-sea and Offshore Fisheries Highlighted by NITI Aayog?


• Lack of Scientific Stock Assessment:Inadequate data and limited use of modern tools like remote sensing, sonar, and AI for mapping deep-sea resourcescan lead to overfishing and unsustainable exploitation of marine resources.Overfishing,bycatch, andmarine pollutionthreaten ecosystem healthand can cause long-term decline of fish stocks and marine biodiversity.
• Weak Infrastructure:Poor harbour facilities, insufficient landing centres, and limited cold chain and processing capacitycause post-harvest losses, reduced fish quality, and lower export potential.
• Technological Gaps:Most vessels lack modernfish-finding equipment,vessel monitoring systems (VMS), and selective fishing gearleading to inefficient fishing, high bycatch, and compromised sustainability.
• Limited Access to Finance:Fisher cooperatives and small operators face difficulties getting institutional credit or insurance coverageresulting in underinvestment in technology and risk mitigation.Current subsidies and schemes are fragmented and not designed for deep-sea operationsleading to slow adoption of green technologies and fleet modernisation.
• Outdated Legal Framework:Existing laws regulate only coastal waters up to 12 nautical miles, leaving deep-sea areas poorly governedwhich creates loopholes and weak enforcement of sustainable fishing.Limited vessel tracking, lack of observer programs, and poor coordination among enforcement agenciesallow illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing to persist.Cross-border fishing and weak surveillance in sensitive maritime zonespose risks to maritime security and the safety of fishers.
• Fragmented policy alignment with SDGs:Lack of integration between fisheries policies and global sustainability goals such asSDG 14 (Life Below Water)hampers holistic development and conservation of marine resources.

• Overfishing,bycatch, andmarine pollutionthreaten ecosystem healthand can cause long-term decline of fish stocks and marine biodiversity.

TheRegistrar General of India (RGI)released the“Vital Statistics of India based on Civil Registration System (CRS)”report for2023. The report highlighted a decline inbirth registrationsand a marginal increase indeath registrations.


What are the Key Findings of the Vital Statistics Report 2023?


• Birth and Death Trends;India registered2.52 crore births in 2023, about2.32 lakh fewerthan in 2022, indicating a slight decline in the overall birth rate.The number ofregistered deaths stood at 86.6 lakh in 2023, aminor increasefrom86.5 lakh in 2022.There had been asharp spike in 2021, with1.02 crore deaths- an excess of nearly21 lakh deathsfrom 2020, coinciding with the second wave of COVID-19.
• Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB):SRB refers to the number of female births per 1,000 male births.Lowest SRB:Reported inJharkhand (899), followed by Bihar (900), Telangana (906), Maharashtra (909), Gujarat (910), Haryana (911), and Mizoram (911).Highest SRB: Arunachal Pradeshled with a sex ratio of1,085 females per 1,000 males, followed by Nagaland (1,007), Goa (973), Ladakh and Tripura (972 each), and Kerala (967).
• Institutional Births:About74.7% of total registered births in 2023occurred in health institutions, reflecting gradual improvement in maternal and neonatal healthcare access.Overall registration of birthsfor the year 2023 stood at98.4%Timelyregistrationrefers tobirths registered within 21 daysof occurrence.

• The number ofregistered deaths stood at 86.6 lakh in 2023, aminor increasefrom86.5 lakh in 2022.
• There had been asharp spike in 2021, with1.02 crore deaths- an excess of nearly21 lakh deathsfrom 2020, coinciding with the second wave of COVID-19.

• Lowest SRB:Reported inJharkhand (899), followed by Bihar (900), Telangana (906), Maharashtra (909), Gujarat (910), Haryana (911), and Mizoram (911).
• Highest SRB: Arunachal Pradeshled with a sex ratio of1,085 females per 1,000 males, followed by Nagaland (1,007), Goa (973), Ladakh and Tripura (972 each), and Kerala (967).

• Timelyregistrationrefers tobirths registered within 21 daysof occurrence.


What are the Reasons for the Skewed Sex Ratio in India?


• Gender Bias:A deep-rooted cultural preference for male heirs continues to dominate Indian society, where females areoften perceived as subordinate. This gender bias manifests in unequal access to education, healthcare, and even survival opportunities for girls.
• Son Preference:Sons are traditionally viewed as future caretakers of parents and the principal economic supporters of the family. This belief reinforces the preference for male children, leading to discriminatory practices against female births.
• Social Practices:Patriarchal customs, particularly thepractice of dowry, further discourage families from raising daughters.The financial burden associated with marriage often makes sons appear as economic assets, while daughters are seen as liabilities.
• Rising Income Paradox:Contrary to expectations, the risein per capita income over the past six decadeshas not improved the sex ratio. Instead, higher income and literacy levels have made sex-selective technologies more accessible, thereby worsening gender imbalance in several regions.


What Measures can be taken to Improve Sex Ratio in India?


• Behavioural Change:Long-term improvement requires a transformation in social attitudes.Government initiatives such as theBeti Bachao Beti Padhaocampaign should be further strengthened to promote gender equality and challenge patriarchal mindsets.
• Youth Sensitization:Reaching out to the youth through reproductive health education and awareness programmes is crucial.The services ofAccredited Social Health Activists (ASHA)can be effectively leveraged in rural areas to spread awareness and encourage equitable practices.
• Law Enforcement:A stronger legal framework is essential to curb sex-selective practices. ThePre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994must be implemented strictly.Additionally, the recent decision of theDrugs Technical Advisory Boardto includeultrasound machines under the Drugs and Cosmetics Actis a welcome step towards preventing their misuse for sex determination.

Registrar General of India


• The Registrar General of Indiawas founded in 1961by the Government of India under theMinistry of Home Affairs.
• It arranges, conducts and analyses the results of the demographic surveys of India including theCensus of Indiaand Linguistic Survey of India.
• The position of Registrar is usually held by a civil servant holding the rank of Joint Secretary.


Civil Registration System(CRS)


• Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is theunified processof continuous, permanent, compulsory and universal recording of the vital events (births, deaths, stillbirths) and characteristics thereof.
• The data generated through a complete and up-to-date CRS isessential for socio-economic planning.
• Registration of Births and Deaths in India is mandatory with the enactment ofRegistration of Births and Deaths (RBD), Act 1969and is done as per the place of occurrence of the event.
• According to the 2020-21 annual report of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Central government is planning torevamp the Civil Registration System (CRS)to enable the registration of birth and death in real-time with minimum human interface that will be independent of location.


Conclusion


India has created several impressive goals to reduce its population growth rates, India and the rest of the world has a long way to go to achieve meaningful population policy which are not only based on quantitative control but qualitative control as well.
